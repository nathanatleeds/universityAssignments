You must get into the directory where the files are stored and open the terminal in the src file. 
First you must enter the command javac WeatherInfo.java to compile the main of the program.
To run it you do java WeatherInfo ../data/*******.txtThe ******** will be replaced with the 
name of a file in the data folder.This will run anyone of these text files. You can also use
 WeatherPlot.java to see a graph of the program.Like with the program before you have to compile 
using the command javac WeatherPlot.java.Then you run the program with java WeatherPlot ../data/*******.txt.
It will then run the program and a graph will appear.
