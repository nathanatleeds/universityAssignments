To compile the program you will need to go to the terminal and access the directory or files where the c file is. Then you put in the command gcc -o textbanners textbanners.c, which will then compile the code. To run the code you then input the command ./textbanners. In the terminal you will then see the an input menu and enter a word. It will then output that word again. It will then  output that same word in ascii format.
