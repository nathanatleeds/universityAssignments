To compile the program you will need to go to the terminal and access the directory or files where the c file is. Then you type in the terminal the word make, which will then compile the code. To run the code you then input the command ./print input.txt. The input.txt is a text file which contains characters which will used in the program. The ./print will give you one of the functions of which will put the text in the input file in a hexidecimel format. You can use ./print -d input.txt which will then give it you in a decimel format. You can have ./print -c input.txt which will give you the hexidecimel format and the actual characters aswell. If you want to change the text file you use, put the text file in the folder and instead input ./print "  ".txt instead (blank being the name of the text file).
