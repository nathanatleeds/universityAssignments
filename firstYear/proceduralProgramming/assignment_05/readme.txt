To compile the program you will need to go to the terminal and access the directory or files
where the c file is. Then you type in the terminal the word make, which will then compile 
the code. To run the code you then input the command ./main cryptotext1.txt. The cryptotext1.txt
is a text file which contains a cipher which will used in the program. The ./main runs the main 
file which then compiles the 3 different modules object file. So all you need to do is 
have ./main "    ", with the relevant text file to decipher the text file code.
