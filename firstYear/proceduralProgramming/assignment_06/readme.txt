To compile the program you will need to go to the terminal and access the directory or files
where the c file is. Then you type in the terminal the word make, which will then compile 
the code. To run the code you then input the command ./word < input.txt. The input.txt
is a text file which contains some text which will used in the program. The ./word runs the main 
file which then compiles the 3 different modules object file. So all you need to do is 
have ./word "    ", with the relevant text file to use the text file in the code. Then the code 
will read the text and then see my words there and the instances. Another way to input the 
text is by doing ./word which will bring up a text input. Input the text and then do ctrl d, 
this will run the program.
