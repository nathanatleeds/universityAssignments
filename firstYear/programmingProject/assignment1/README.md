To load the program you must first enter the command "make" in the terminal. Then you must do the command "./main" to run the main function. Then you will come up with a list of all the functions that are being ran at the moment in time. This is pretty useless, so you must use gnu. You then type in the command "gnuplot" and then a window will come up which will say about the gnu software. You will then type in the command " load 'quad.gnu' " which will come up with a graph plot of what the quadtree in the function looks like. You then press q to exit the gnu program.
